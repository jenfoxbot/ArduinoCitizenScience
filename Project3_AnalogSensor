/* Using Arduino for Citizen Science!
   Project 3: Simple Analog Sensors: Photoresistor, aka light sensor!
      Connect  one lead of your sensor to the 5V power out.
      Connect one resistor lead to the remaining sensor lead, 
           and the other resistor lead to GND.
      Connect a jumper wire between the sensor lead and the resistor to A0.

  //2) Print the sensor value

  //3) Add a small delay so we can keep up w/ those readings
